This is the CAD (Computer-Aided Design) representation of the robot, meticulously created and designed using the powerful and versatile software tool, SOLIDWORKS. CAD, in this context, refers to the digital embodiment of the robot, offering a comprehensive 3D model that serves as the foundation for its physical realization and operational functionalities.

The core of this project is in the 'squelette' folder, a key component in the design process. In SOLIDWORKS, an 'SLDAM' file typically signifies an assembly file, a digital environment where multiple parts and components are methodically arranged to construct a complex structure, such as a robot. The 'squelette.SLDAM' assembly file served as the primary source, housing the fundamental building blocks and mechanical elements that form the robot's core framework.

To achieve a higher level of detail and precision, the next step involved extracting individual part files from 'squelette.SLDAM.' SOLIDWORKS allows for the creation of separate part files for each constituent element of the robot. These part files capture intricate details, geometric properties, and specific features of each component, enabling in-depth analysis and modification.

Additionally, the project encompasses the 'assemblage' assembly file. Similar to 'Squelette.SLDAM,' 'assemblage' is an assembly file within SOLIDWORKS, but it represents the fully assembled robot. This file contains all the individual parts and components, showcasing how they come together to form the complete robot structure.

A notable aspect of this project is the use of SOLIDWORKS for animation. It involves the dynamic visualization and simulation of the robot's motion and behavior. SOLIDWORKS offers sophisticated animation tools that enable designers and engineers to virtually animate the robot, providing insights into how it moves and interacts with its surroundings. This animated representation is invaluable for testing and refining the robot's performance before any physical prototypes are constructed.

In summary, the CAD of the robot is a complex project that begins with the 'Squelette.SLDAM' assembly file. This file serves as the foundational structure from which individual part files are derived, allowing for detailed modeling of each component. The 'assemblage' assembly file, on the other hand, showcases the fully assembled robot. Furthermore, the use of SOLIDWORKS for animation adds an extra layer of depth to the project, providing a dynamic view of the robot's functionality and behavior."

This detailed description provides a comprehensive overview of the CAD project and its various components, highlighting the meticulous design process and the advantages of using SOLIDWORKS for both static modeling and dynamic simulation.
